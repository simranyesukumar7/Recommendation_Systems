# 📚 Book Recommendation System 

Welcome to the **Book Recommendation System** repository! This system uses three different recommendation techniques to help you discover your next favorite book:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🔍
2. **Collaborative Filtering** 🤝
3. **Popularity-Based Filtering** 🌟

The system is built on the [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data) from Kaggle, which contains awesome details about books, user ratings, and other metadata — everything you need for building a top-notch recommendation engine! 📖✨

## 🚀 Methods

### 1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Recommendation** 📏
KNN is like a matchmaker for books! It finds the most similar books based on their features (genre, author, etc.) and recommends them to you.

- **How it works:**  
  The KNN model calculates the "distance" between books based on their features in a multi-dimensional space. Then, it suggests the closest books (without suggesting the one you already asked about, of course!).

### 2. **Collaborative Filtering** 🤝
Collaborative Filtering is a social butterfly that recommends books based on what other users like — like asking your friends for book recommendations!

- **Types of Collaborative Filtering:**
  - **User-User Filtering:** Recommends books liked by people who are similar to you.
  - **Item-Item Filtering:** Recommends books that are similar to those you've liked before.
  
- **How it works:**  
  We calculate the similarity between users or books using math (like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation) and recommend books from the closest neighbors. 📊

### 3. **Popularity-Based Filtering** 🌟
Popularity-Based Filtering is all about the crowd! It recommends books that are highly rated or have been loved by many readers.

- **How it works:**  
  Books are ranked based on their popularity (number of ratings or average rating) and the top N most popular books are recommended. 📈
